I bought an HP 3311A from an eBay seller who packed it improperly, so
all the plastic banana jack covers were shattered when it arrived.
This is not so great in and of itself, but it saved me a bit of work:
they had clearly been in rough shape and superglued back together by
someone who didn't know what they were doing.

This is a model for replacements.  I'm trying to stay true to the
original design, though I'm not up for the complexities of the
two-color approach they used just yet.


It turns out that the standoffs that hold the plugs in the chassis
were also mangled.  There is a model for this in here as well, which
is _not_ true to the original design.  The original design is a
masterpiece of injection molding, with lots of elegant little details.
None of which can be pulled off with a 3D printer.  So, I redesigned
the capture mechanism to work with a 3D printer, but retain the stock
stack-up of components.
